# pl27265_FPGA Final Project Proposal: Smart Vending Machines

# Overview
I would like to build a control system that operates vending machine based on FPGA board

# Implementation Strategy
This project divided into three parts: 1. Data flow 2. Control State machine 3. Display part

# Procedure
First, users could choose 16 type products. Input the number of products and then press the button.
Secondly, give the price of the products & wait for the machine operating.
Finlay, get the product and the changes.

# Tasks
1. Develop the system process
2. Using Verilog to implement the three part 
3. Test and verify the function with Vivado and FPGA board 

Estimated Timeline
1. Task 1 (3-4 day)
2. Task 2 (1-2 weeks)
3. Task 3 (2-3 day)
